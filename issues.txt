I've added sending mail facility and overrided some django-allauth settings here are some 
problems to troubleshoot :-

1. all details are not saving after signup (such as:- gender,lastname etc)
2. it stores the data before confirmation of email and doesn't have any variables/methods to
    detect whether the user is authorised or not.
